## Thank you
For considering AMYBO for Kickstarting for Good.  I've just recorded this bang up to date <9 minute introduction for you.  If the science bores you (starting 2m 55s in), feel free to skip to the finance section 7m 10s in:

Forgive me for not fully customising the video for Kickstarting for Good.  I imagine you'd appreciate my making a fully recyclable video  as I thought we could do with a general-use pitch video...  If you'd like a fully customised version, lets arrange a time for a video call.

Otherwise, here are some other things that you should probably know about this website:
- We launched it 26 June 2023
- It initially started as a research document repository 
- But we then launched the [YouTube channel](https://YouTube.com/@amybo) where we started running weekly livestreams that took over from initial documentation.
- Our [Forum](https://forum.amybo.org) followed not long after that.
- The YouTube channel wasn't getting as many subscribers as we hoped, probably because YouTube only promotes livestreams while they are streaming
- So we moved to regular edited YouTube videos, which definitely got more views
- Hours after posting the [New Year New Culture](https://youtu.be/CfzGvK5tgiQ?si=IgQ0lpzHzJ8VVvY2) video, I (Martin) got a payment failure notification from my bank.  I had been so frantically working on the videos, buying anything we needed (and a few things we didn't) that I took my eyes off the cashflow.
- From that point focus has shifted grant applications. We collaborate on these in a ClickUp account, hence there hasn't been as much action in our other channels as we would have liked.
- There is however a tonne of other stuff we've been working on, so please do get in touch, I/we would love to chat.
