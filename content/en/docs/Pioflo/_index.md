## Affordable, infinitely scaleable bioreactor

The basic concept of Pioflo is that we turn the tried-and-tested pioreactor into a flow through cell.  This means that any size of CSTR (completely stirred tank reactor) can be converted to a bioreactor by adding a Pioflo to control the CSTR by real-time measurement of optical density.
