## First attempt
![Photograph of pioreactor 20ml v1.0 configured as a flow through cell with a 1L beaker of Kombucha in the background and a 20ml vial of Kombucha in the foreground](/docs/Pioflo/Pioflo_v0_01_73A7651.webp)
### Bill of Materials
1. 1x [Pioreactor 20ml v1.0](https://pioreactor.com/products/pioreactor-20ml) normally configured
1. 1x [12V peristaltic pump](https://pioreactor.com/collections/accessories-and-parts/products/peristaltic-pump).  This means that any size of <abbr title="completely stirred tank reactor">CSTR</abbr> can be converted to a bioreactor by adding a Pioflo to control the <abbr title="completely stirred tank reactor">CSTR</abbr> using real-time measurement of optical density.
