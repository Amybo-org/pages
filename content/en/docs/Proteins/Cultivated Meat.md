The [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/cultivated/) and [New Harvest](https://new-harvest.org/what-is-cellular-agriculture/#cellular-products) have useful primers on cultivated meat and cellular argiculture.  This may play an important role in mimicking and replacing traditional meat.  However, the complexity and cost of doing so, without any significant nutritional benefits over single-cell proteins, mean that it may be best left to well-funded enterprises..?
