## Our Open Source Autoclave Shortlist

### Oh dear, this is a short list
### There are however controllers:
*[Autoclave_control](https://github.com/zultron/autoclave_control)
*[RAMIRO-GM](https://github.com/RAMIRO-GM/autoclave)
*[iSpecc iControl System](https://www.ispecc.com/controls/composite-control-systems-2)

## Pressure cookers

### Electronic

#### [Metallic Black GPC201SS-20 5.5L 1000W Pressure Cooker](https://direct.asda.com/george/home/cooking-appliances/metallic-black-gpc201ss-20-55l-1000w-pressure-cooker/050019614,default,pd.html)

Exciting features for Amybo (as of June 2023):

* Low price
* Can be used outside the kitchen (no hob required)

Concerns (as of June 2023):

* Can it accurately monitor and control temperature and pressure?
* Will condensation be an issue? (Autoclaves use dry steam)

### Stovetop

Concerns (as of June 2023):

1. How can this maintain pressure, and if it doesn't how can it be called an autoclave?
