Once you have determined which protein you wish to cultivate, the next question is what you are going to cultivate it in.  There is a need for development of better and more efficient bioreactors across the board - but, given the nature of this project, it makes sense to, at least initially, restrict our scope to open source bioreactors.

## Bioreactor Shortlist

### [Pioreactor](https://pioreactor.com)
> "The Pioreactor is an open-source, affordable, and extensible bioreactor platform.["](https://docs.pioreactor.com/user-guide/introduction)

It currently comes in a cute and cost-effective 20 ml version that can be used in batch, fed batch, continuous, chemostat, turbidostat & PID morbidostat modes.  While the software is already [open source](https://github.com/pioreactor/), we understand from the founder that the hardware and 3D designs are due to be made open source in 2023.

Exciting features for Amybo (as of June 2023):

* it appears to be more affordable than most automated bioreactors
* it will soon be fully open source, hence customisable
* it is clearly under active development
* it is available for sale with excellent lead times
* you can add LEDs as a light source for algae
* the system is compatible with [DormantBioLabResources](https://github.com/oplz/DormantBioLabResources/tree/main/Prints/dovetailed_rack)' open source modular lab racks

Wish list (as of June 2023):

1. Ability to automatically upload results to a [project cloud database](https://forum.pioreactor.com/t/project-cloud-database/135?u=martin)
2. [larger vessels](https://forum.pioreactor.com/t/looking-for-users-who-need-more-volume/130) - so probes can be added
3. Easy-open viewport cover (it currently requires 4 screws)
4. 3D printer files - to minimise shipping cost & carbon, and enable community development
5. Ability to control temperature below ambient
6. Ability to wall-mount for bioreactor farms & video production
7. Fully assembled units (including pre-configured raspberry pi's) for technophobes
8. Global stockists - to reduce shipping time, cost and carbon
9. A way to be certain that reactor overflow isn't going to fry your raspberry pi
