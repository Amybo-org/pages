Microscopes are third on the list of major open source equipment, because it is very possible to conduct fermentation without a microscope.  It would however be much more difficult and less rewarding if you could never see your microbes.  Microscopy also plays a valuable role in detecting contamination by unwanted microbes.

Fortunately there are a good number of open source microscopy projects:
