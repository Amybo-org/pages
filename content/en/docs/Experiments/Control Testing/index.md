To ensure that the Pioreactors we're using are working as expected, we ran an experiment where we used the exact same experimental conditions with two Pioreactors, with the hope to produce the same results.

The original experiment is described on the [Pioreactor website](https://docs.pioreactor.com/experiments/control-testing).

## Protocol

### Preparing and sterilizing the media

1. [Prepare YPD broth media](https://www.tiktok.com/@pioreactor/video/7130702807656697093) for three 15mL vials.
1. Pour 300mL tap water into the pressure cooker, place the three vials on the metal trivet in the pressure cooker and turn to a high setting.
1. Once the water in the cooker starts to boil, steam will come out of the open valve. Put the heaviest weight (15lb) weight on top of the valve.
1. The steam will lift the weight and start to escape. As soon as the steam starts to escape, start timing the sterilization and turn down the heat so that the steam is only just escaping and not rushing out. Aim to maintain a gentle hissing.
1. After 20 minutes turn off the heat and leave to cool.
1. Wait until pressure is completely reduced then lift the weight off the valve allowing any remaining steam to escape. **Never open the pressure cooker until the steam
valve has been opened to release the pressure.**

### Running the experiment

1. Dilute a small amount of baker's yeast in 15mL of YPD broth media
1. Innoculate the three sterile vials with the same amount (just a drop) of culture from the stock solution.
1. Wipe the vials and place them in the Pioreactors.
1. Start a new experiment on your Pioreactor dashboard.
1. Select *Manage all Pioreactors*
1. Start *Stirring* activity
1. Start *Temperature automation* activity and set to 30Â°C
1. Start *OD reading activity*
1. Go back to the graphs and check that an Optical Density (OD) signal is being received.
1. Select *Manage all Pioreators* again and start *Growth rate*.
