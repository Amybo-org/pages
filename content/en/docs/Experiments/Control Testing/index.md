title: Control Testing
description: A simple control test evaluating results between Pioreactors, by Gerrit Niezen

To ensure that the Pioreactors we're using are working as expected, we ran an experiment where we used the exact same experimental conditions with two Pioreactors, with the hope to produce the same results.

The original experiment is described on the [Pioreactor website](https://docs.pioreactor.com/experiments/control-testing).
