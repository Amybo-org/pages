## Kit List
We're still optimising the kit list for Hydrogen Oxidising Bacteria (HOB) enrichment, please see this discussion on the [Bill of Materials](https://forum.AMYBO.org/t/bill-of-materials/57) for the latest.

## Media
We're reasonably happy with our [mesonutrients](https://forum.AMYBO.org/t/hob-culture-medium-ingredients/53/4) (other than perhaps the Calcium Chloride) but more work is required for us to be able to recommend an optimal food grade micronutrient solution.  In the meantime there are many options if you're happy to go non-food grade - see [Trace element solution](https://forum.AMYBO.org/t/trace-element-solution/56/21) for our latest thoughts.
