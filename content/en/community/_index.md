{{% pageinfo %}} Well this page is clearly broken - [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev) has deviated from its standard page-builder formula and decided to add it's own stuff above, then badly format what would normally be the main content (below).  Otherwise it seems like a great system.  We'll fix this, but there are a few higher priorities for now...  If you think community should be our highest priority, then please do [Join us](/docs/contribition-guidelines) and feel free to fix this page! {{% /pageinfo %}}

As well as attracting the best experts from a huge number of fields to join us, we would also like as many lay-people as possible to get to know about open source protein fermentation as possible.

In due course, we're clearly going to need some safe spaces for experts to communicate using whatever technical language is most efficient for them.  Right now, our first priority is to get the message out, otherwise those experts may never find us.

It's a crazy idea, I know, but I imagine the best way's of growing this community will be via open social media, using inclusive jargon-free language.  Let's start with [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@amybo) comments, and perhaps one more conventional social media channel (LinkedIn..?), so we don't spread ourselves too thin, and try to build critical mass there.  

What do you think?
