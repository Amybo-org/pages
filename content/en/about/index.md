Amybo was kicked off in 2023 by [Martin Currie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincurrie/), following inspiration from:
* [George Monbiot](https://www.monbiot.com)'s [Embrace what may be the most important green technology ever. It could save us all.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/24/green-technology-precision-fermentation-farming) Guardian Article, which put him on to:
* [Reboot Food](https://www.rebootfood.org), which got him googling for open source protein fermentation projects, where he found not much more than:
* [Domingo Club](https://domingoclub.com/documentation/domingo-fermenter)'s lovely open soure Tempeh fermenter and:
* [Gerrit Niezen](https://gerritniezen.com/how-to-open-source-precision-fermentation), who was also "Not finding any open-source precision fermentation projects online", but linked to
* [Pioreactor](https://pioreactor.com), founded by
* [
Cam Davidson Pilon](https://forum.pioreactor.com/u/camdavidsonpilon/summary) who also hadn't seen much, but thought:
* the [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org), or
* [New Harvest](https://new-harvest.org) would know.
* Martin eventually read [George Monbiot](https://www.monbiot.com)'s [Regenesis - Feeding the World without Devouring the Planet](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/317018/regenesis-by-monbiot-george/9780241447642), and was spurred on to action by
* [Amanda Lake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-lake-9b909221/) of [IChemE](https://www.icheme.org)
* and many others.

CONFESSION: The image of the blueberry porridge that we're currently using on this page and our front page isn't actually fermented protein, it's a public domain stock image by [iha31](https://pixabay.com/users/iha31-560629/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=531209) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=531209) which happened to come from [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev)'s [template](https://github.com/google/docsy-example).  It may well be that we develop a protein porridge that looks much like this, when served with blueberries, so in the interest of focusing on more important stuff we've left it as-is.  If you have a better image that you'd like to contribute, please do, otherwise we may try to generate a more appropriate placeholder with Dall-E, midjourney, etc. and eventually some real photos of real open source proteins or processes.
