Amybo was kicked off in 2023 by [Martin Currie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincurrie/) following inspiration from [reboot food](https://www.rebootfood.org), [Gerrit Niezen](https://gerritniezen.com/how-to-open-source-precision-fermentation), [
Cam Davidson Pilon](https://forum.pioreactor.com/u/camdavidsonpilon/summary) at [Pioreactor](https://pioreactor.com), the [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org), [New Harvest](https://new-harvest.org), [George Monbiot](https://www.monbiot.com) and his book [Regenesis - Feeding the World without Devouring the Planet](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/317018/regenesis-by-monbiot-george/9780241447642), [Amanda Lake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-lake-9b909221/) and many others.

CONFESSION: The image of the blueberry porridge that we're currently using on this page and our front page isn't actually fermented protein, it's a public domain stock image by [iha31](https://pixabay.com/users/iha31-560629/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=531209) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=531209) which happened to come from [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev)'s [template](https://github.com/google/docsy-example).  It may well be that we develop a protein porridge that looks much like this, when served with blueberries, so in the interest of focusing on more important stuff we've left it as-is.  If you have a better image that you'd like to contribute, please do, otherwise we'll either try to generate a more appropriate placeholder with Dall-E, midjourney, etc. and eventually some real photos of real open source proteins or processes.
